# Responsive Portfolio


## Description

   This is a portfolio that is responsive on all viewports, in order to optimize viewing potential and accessability for potential employers.
   It is built with three pages; the home page containing an About Me, the Portfolio containing six images, and the contact page where you can send a message to the subject. Each page has a nav bar that is consistent across all pages for easily moving back and forth if desired. 

   This project provides a basic but fun and attention grabbing layout that can be applied to any portfolio page, or even a small business or product website. 

   In this project I learned about grids; using rows and columns to apply basic layout in Bootstrap.
